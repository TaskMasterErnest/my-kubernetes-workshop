# my-kubernetes-workshop
A repo containing my deep dive into how Kubernetes functions in detail.

## Why Am I Doing This?
- I have found my Kubernetes knowledge lacking in certain areas and I need to bridge those gaps.
- Kubernetes is now a constant tool in application deployment so I have to get up to speed with it.
- It will be fun to learn (all over again but in more detail) how Kubernetes works (almost not as the first point lol!)
- Maybe I can get a job working with Kubernetes if someone comes across this repo. (I will never know)
